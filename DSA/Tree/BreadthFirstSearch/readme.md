# ðŸŒ³ Manual Breadth-First Search (BFS) in Binary Tree

This file demonstrates how to manually implement **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** in a binary tree using Python â€” without using any built-in queue libraries or modules. The idea is to build a custom FIFO queue and traverse level-by-level (left to right) across the binary tree.

## ðŸ“Œ BFS Concept

**Breadth-First Search** visits all nodes of a tree level-by-level from top to bottom and left to right. The left and right child of a node are enqueued and explored in order.

---

## ðŸ§  Key Highlights

- **Manual queue logic** using a Python list (`append()` and slicing)
- **Custom `Node` class** to represent each node in the binary tree
- **Separate function to search** an element using BFS
- Simple code that builds understanding from scratch

- The BFS traversal order
- The code involved for both traversal and search

## ðŸ’¡ Use Cases

- Great for learning how queues work under the hood
- BFS is often used in shortest path problems, level-order tree traversal, and more
- This implementation avoids external libraries for better understanding of internal mechanics
