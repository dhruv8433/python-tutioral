# ðŸ“¦ Queue Implementation Using List (Custom Logic)

This file demonstrates how to implement a **Queue** in Python using a **list** with custom logic â€” no built-in queue modules or `collections.deque`. Itâ€™s a great way to understand the fundamentals of **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** data structures.

## ðŸ“Œ Queue Concept

A **Queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** principle. The element that is enqueued first will be dequeued first. In this implementation, we track `front`, `rear`, and `size` manually to manage queue operations.

## ðŸ§  Key Highlights

- âœ… Manually manages `front`, `rear`, and `size`
- âœ… Uses a Python list to simulate queue behavior
- âœ… Custom implementation â€” no built-in queue usage
- âœ… Core operations include:
  - `enqueue(data)` â€” Add an item to the rear
  - `dequeue()` â€” Remove the front item
  - `print()` â€” Print all elements from front to rear

## ðŸ“· Visual Explanation

This is how the queue evolves with enqueue and dequeue:
