# ðŸ§± Stack Implementation Using Linked List

This project provides a manual implementation of a **Stack** using a **Linked List** in Python. Unlike array-based stacks, linked list stacks dynamically allocate memory and are more efficient for frequent insertions/removals.

## ðŸ“Œ Stack Concept

A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)** principle. In this implementation, we use **nodes** where each node holds data and a reference to the next node. The `top` pointer always points to the last added element.

## ðŸ§  Key Highlights

- âœ… Built with custom `Node` class to represent each stack element
- âœ… Dynamically allocates memory (no fixed size)
- âœ… No use of built-in collections â€” purely logic-based
- âœ… Core operations include:
  - `push(item)` â€” Add a new node to the top
  - `pop()` â€” Remove the top node
  - `peek()` â€” Access the top node's value
  - `print()` â€” Traverse and print all elements from top to bottom

## ðŸ’¡ Use Cases

- Memory-efficient alternative to list-based stacks
- Handling function calls and backtracking
- Used in low-level system designs (where arrays are costly)
- Useful in implementing undo features and parsing logic
