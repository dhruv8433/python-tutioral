# ðŸ“¦ Queue Implementation Using Linked List

This file showcases a **custom implementation of a Queue** in Python using a **linked list**. It follows the classic **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** structure and is built from scratch â€” without using Python's built-in data structures for queues.

## ðŸ“Œ Queue Concept

A **Queue** is a linear data structure where elements are inserted at the **rear** and removed from the **front**. This implementation uses a **singly linked list**, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node.

## ðŸ§  Key Highlights

- âœ… Custom `Node` class to represent queue elements
- âœ… Dynamically sized â€” no fixed capacity
- âœ… No shifting or resizing needed like arrays
- âœ… Tracks `front`, `rear`, and `size` of the queue
- âœ… Core operations include:
  - `enqueue(data)` â†’ Add to the rear
  - `dequeue()` â†’ Remove from the front
  - `print()` â†’ Display all elements
  - `get_front()` / `get_rare()` â†’ Get front or rear value
  - `get_size()` â†’ Get the number of elements

## ðŸ’¡ Use Cases

- Handling real-time tasks (e.g., printer queues, customer service)
- Thread-safe task scheduling
- Data buffering and streaming
- Tree and graph traversal algorithms
